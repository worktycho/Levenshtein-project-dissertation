abstract="Given a text string of lengthn and a pattern string of lengthm over ab-letter alphabet, thek differences approximate string matching problem asks for all locations in the text where the pattern occurs with at mostk differences (substitutions, insertions, deletions). We treatk not as a constant but as a fraction ofm (not necessarily constant-fraction). Previous algorithms require at leastO(kn) time (or exponential space). We give an algorithm that is sublinear time0((n/m)k log                                          b                                        m) when the text is random andk is bounded by the threshold m/(logb                        m + O(1)). In particular, whenk=o(m/logb                        m) the expected running time iso(n). In the worst case our algorithm is O(kn), but is still an improvement in that it is practical and uses0(m) space compared with0(n) or0(m                        2). We define three problems motivated by molecular biology and describe efficient algorithms based on our techniques: (1) approximate substring matching, (2) approximate-overlap detection, and (3) approximate codon matching. Respectively, applications to biology are local similarity search, sequence assembly, and DNA-protein matching.",
